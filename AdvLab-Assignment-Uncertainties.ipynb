Because of parasitic phenomena, sensitivity of the experiment to noise, or mis-reading of scales, the result we get are generally not the exact value we would like it to be. Moreover, when repeating the same measurement, we often obtain a different result! These \"errors\" in measurements, more properly called **uncertainties**, need to be properly estimated and quoted when you write up your results. Failure to do so may mean that your results are useless. \n",

    "The uncertainty in a <i>non-repeated</i> measurement can be estimated as **the minimum resolution of the measuring device**. This is often quoted as being half of the smallest division of the measuring apparatus. For example, a reasonable estimate of uncertainty in a single measurement with a typical meter stick, which has ticks every one millimeter, is &plusmn;&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;mm. Similary, with a digital voltmeter that diplays three significant digits, like 3.73&nbsp;V, the uncertainty would correspond to half the value associated with the least significant digit, in this case &plusmn;&nbsp;0.005&nbsp;V.\n",

Say for example that your voltage reading varies betwen 3.68 and&nbsp;3.76&nbsp;V. In that case, you would quote the measurement as the mean value between the minimum and maximum value you can read, (3.68 V + 3.76 V) / 2 = 3.72 V, and the uncertainty as half the spread of values, (3.76 V &minus;&nbsp;3.68 V) / 2 = 0.04 V, giving you for this example a reading of 3.72&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.04&nbsp;V. More on this below.\n",

For these labs, we will assume that all our uncertainties have a *Gaussian statistical distribution*. For x = 4 &plusmn; 0.1, that means that the probability distribution that leads to these (seemingly) random values for *x* as we keep measuring it have a Gaussian distribution, centered on 4 (the mean) and with a 0.1 standard deviation. Gaussian distributions have that property that there is a 68% chance that the actual (exact) value is within &plusmn;&nbsp;1 standard deviation of the nominal value (here, 4). Distributions are not always Gaussians but there are many reasons why they often turn out to be Gaussian.

The fact that the uncertainty $\\sigma_z$ is not just the direct sum of the uncertainties (which would be larger) reflects the fact that, given that the uncertainties are random (and have random signs), they will not always act in the same direction.

In particular, we do not know if it is larger or smaller than&nbsp;5. If I consider a second variable, *y* = 3 &plusmn; 0.2, again I do not know whether the true value of *y* is larger or smaller than&nbsp;3. Now if *x* and *y* are *independent*, the fact that the true value of *x* is &mdash; say &mdash; larger than&nbsp;5 does not imply anything as to the true value of *y*. It could still be larger or smaller than&nbsp;3 with equal probabilities. There are no **correlations** between the errors on the two variables &mdash; in particular their relative sign is random. In contrast, **dependant** variables would exhibit such correlations. For example, we may know, because of specificities of the experiment, that if I measure a value for *x* that is too large, then my measurement for the value of *y* will also be too large. Such uncertainties are said to **correlated**, hence **not independent**. If the uncertainties of two variables systematically have the opposite sign, they are said to be **anti-correlated**.\n",

Even if you have many intermediate results, that depend somehow on the same variable(s), it will correctly track the dependant and independant variables for you.
