      "source": "# Experiment 203: Basic Electrical Measurements\n\n#### Aim\n\nTo use a digital multimeter and oscilloscope to measure dc and ac voltage, dc and ac current, resistance, capacitance, time, frequency and phase. You may be unfamiliar with these instruments or the components measured. If so, don’t hesitate to ask a demonstrator for assistance.\n\n#### Ohm's law\nThe most important thing you need to know for this experiment is Ohm's law:\n\\begin{equation} V=IR\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $V$ is a voltage across a resistor, $I$ is the current going through that resistor, and $R$ is the resistance of that resistor.\n\n#### The voltage division theorem\n\n<p>Imagine you have a voltage source connected to two resistors in series, as illustrated in the figure below.\nThe voltage across the combination of resistors is the voltage of the source. But what is the voltage across each resistor? </p>\n\n![](https://advlabsvr.phy.auckland.ac.nz/pamphlets/figs/f26100.png)\n\n<p>Ohm's law will help. The current going through both resistors is the same, as current is a flow of electrons, and the flow of electrons is conserved. This current is equal to $I=V_s/(R_1+R_2)$.\nBut if we know what the resistance of $R_1$ is, and we know the current, we know what the voltage across that resistor is, namely $V_1=I R_1$. Likewise for $V_2$.</p>\n    \nThe net result is that \n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand hence, as $V_1+V_2=V_s$,\n$$ V_1 = \\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} V_s $$\nThis is the voltage division theorem.\n\n#### Parallel resistors\n<p> Now imagine you have two resistors in parallel, as in the figure below. What would be the equivalent resistance of the two-resistor network? This will allow us to figure out how much current will run. </p>\n    \n![](https://advlabsvr.phy.auckland.ac.nz/pamphlets/figs/f26100b.png)\n\n<p> Again we call on Ohm's law. The voltage across both resistors is the same $V_s=I_1R_1=I_2R_2$. We also know that $I_1+I_2=I$. </p>\nNow let us fill this in to figure out what the resistance $R_T$ of the network is.\n\\begin{equation} R_T=\\frac{V_s}{I}=\\frac{V_s}{I_1+I_2}=\\frac{V_s}{\\frac{V_s}{R_1}+\\frac{V_s}{R_2}}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}}\n\\end{equation}</p>\n\n<p>This basic result will come in handy when interpreting the results in step 11.</p>\n\n<H4>The Digital Multimeter (DMM)</H4>\n<p>\nThe Fluke 77 Digital multimeter supplied measures ac and dc currents and voltages, and also resistance. This model by default is auto-ranging, that is, it adjusts its display to give the most accurate reading of the quantity measured, in 3 or 4 digits. The rotating selector switch selects the type of measurement. When not in use, always turn this to the left-most “off” position.

A non-ideal, linear voltage source may be represented by either the Thevenin (voltage source) equivalent circuit of Figure 3(a) or the Norton (current source) equivalent circuit of Figure 3(b). The resistances are called internal resistances.\n![Fig3](https://advlabsvr.phy.auckland.ac.nz/pamphlets/figs/f26103.png)\nThe “single circle” symbol represents an ideal voltage source. An “overlapping double circle” symbol represents an ideal current source. An ideal current source adjusts its terminal voltage to supply the same current regardless of the impedance across its terminals. This is a less intuitive concept than an ideal voltage source, but is useful for describing the properties of components such as transistors. Both symbols must be accompanied by an arrow showing the assumed direction of positive current flow from the source.\nDetermine values for $V_T, R_T, I_N, {\\rm and\\ } R_N$ of the Thevenin and Norton sources that would best reproduce the data you plotted in Procedure (5). Note: The rules for transforming between equivalent voltage and current sources are:\n\n    - The value of the internal resistance is the same for both (that is, $R_T = R_N$ ).</LI>\n    - The values of the ideal voltage and ideal current sources are related by Ohm’s Law\n    (i.e $I_N =V_T/R_T$).\n"

This will only be true if its terminal resistance is infinite, or alternatively, it draws no current from the circuit. However, all voltage measuring devices have a finite terminal impedance, although so far component values have been chosen to make the effect of the DMM imperceptible.\nThe equivalent circuit of a voltmeter is shown in Figure 4, inside the dashed box. RM is the internal resistance, and the circle symbol represents an ideal galvanometer, which has zero resistance. Thus, the resistance seen between the voltmeter terminals is just RM , and the voltage indicated by the meter is that developed across RM .\nWe use the DMM to measure its own terminal resistance RM , as follows (see Figure 4).\n</LI></OL>\n![Fig4](https://advlabsvr.phy.auckland.ac.nz/pamphlets/figs/f26104.png)"
